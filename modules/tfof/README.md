# The Forge of Fury

> Adventure for Levels 3-5

The Forge of Fury, by Richard Baker, was originally published in 2000 as an adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. The adventure was published shortly after The Sunless Citadel and was designed as a follow-up to it. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.
