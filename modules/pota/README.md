# Princes of the Apocalypse

**An Apocalyptic Adventure for Levels 1-15**

The first signs are always small: bandits on the roads, pirates on the Dessarin River, monster sightings throughout the Sumber Hills - all too close to the lands of civilized folk. Are these events all some bizarre coincidence, or is there a deeper reason behind them?

Working through its prophets, the Elder Elemental Eye has emerged to spread chaos across the Forgotten Realms. How will the adventurers prevent absolute devastation?

• **Rollable tables**, **detailed maps**, and **a wealth of stats** to run this **255-page apocalyptic adventure**
