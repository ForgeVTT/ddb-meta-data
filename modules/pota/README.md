# Princes of the Apocalypse

> Adventure for Levels 1-15

## Primordial Evil Threatens the Realms

> Prevent elemental annihilation in this adventure for the world's greatest roleplaying game

The first signs are always small: bandits on the roads, pirates on the Dessarin River, monster sightings throughout the Sumber Hills all too close to the lands of civilized folk.

To top things off, a delegation from the dwarven city of Mirabar has gone missing. Are these events all some bizarre coincidence, or is there a deeper reason behind them?

Working through its prophets, the Elder Elemental Eye has emerged to spread chaos across the Forgotten Realms. How will the adventurers prevent absolute devastation?
