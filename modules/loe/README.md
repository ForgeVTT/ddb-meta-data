# Lairs of Etharis

From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrific aberrations lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountain ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. Can you hunt, salvage, and survive the monsters of Etharis?

Each of the adventures contained within can be run by themselves or as part of an ongoing campaign. _Lairs of Etharis_ is the perfect introduction to the Grim Hollow campaign setting and includes:

* Explore **20 ready-made horror fantasy adventures for** **levels 1-20** with **maps** for each one.
* **Contains both _Lairs of Etharis_ Volume 1 & 2.**

Hungry for more dark fantasy? Explore the cosmic-horror-fueled _Dungeons of Drakkenheim_!
