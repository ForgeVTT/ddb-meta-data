# Lairs of Etharis

From its deep and forbidding forests, where horrific aberrations lurk, to the hulking and impenetrable mountain ranges where lost legacies lie, the landscape of Etharis is formidable. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. Can you hunt, salvage, and survive the monsters of Etharis?

Each of the adventures contained within can be run by themselves or as part of an ongoing campaign. _Lairs of Etharis_ is the perfect introduction to the Grim Hollow campaign setting and includes:

- Explore **20 ready-made horror fantasy adventures for levels 1-20** with **maps** for each one.
- Hunt **75+ new horror-themed monsters** in the **D&D Beyond Encounter Builder**, and learn to salvage their remains to craft new magic items.
- A host of new player options available to use: **2 new feats**, **7 spells**, and **10 magic items** in the **D&D Beyond character builder**
- **Contains both _Lairs of Etharis_ Volume 1 & 2.**
