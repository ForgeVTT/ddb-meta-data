Each lair contains:</p><ul><li>A unique, action-oriented boss with memorable, dynamic villain actions</li><li>Every monster stat block you need to run the lair. That’s more than 140 unique stat blocks!</li><li>A treasure hoard tailored to the dungeon’s denizens that includes an original magic item and other unique rewards</li><li>A full-color map, including a DM version with all the information needed to run the dungeon and a player version that omits secret doors and traps</li><li>Detailed descriptions of traps, hazards, and NPCs</li><li>Maps and monsters that can be used with DDB's Encounters Tool and Maps tool</li></ul>",
