# Where Evil Lives

The best dungeons have fun boss battles, exciting hazards, and glorious treasure.

_Where Evil Lives: The MCDM Book of Boss Battles_ has all that, plus everything you need to run a lair out of the book in a moment’s notice. Use a premade dungeon when you have nothing else planned or build an entire campaign that leads up to a climactic encounter in a lair.

This book includes 22 dungeons designed for levels 2-20, with at least one dungeon for each level of play. Each lair contains:

* A unique, action-oriented boss with memorable, dynamic villain actions
* Every monster stat block you need to run the lair. That’s more than 140 unique stat blocks!
* A treasure hoard tailored to the dungeon’s denizens that includes an original magic item and other unique rewards
* A full-color map, including a DM version with all the information needed to run the dungeon and a player version that omits secret doors and traps
* Detailed descriptions of traps, hazards, and NPCs
