# The Wild Beyond the Witchlight

Something wicked this way comes in a Feywild Adventure for Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition for players levels 1-8

Once every eight years, the fantastic **Witchlight Carnival** touches down on your world, bringing joy to one settlement after the next. Its owners, Mister Witch and Mister Light, know how to put on a good show. But there’s more to this magical extravaganza than meets the eye!

The carnival is a gateway to a fantastic **Feywild** domain unlike anything found on the Material Plane. Time has not been kind to this realm, however, and dark days lie ahead unless someone can thwart the dastardly schemes of the Hourglass Coven.

Journey to the Feywild and find:

* The first official Dungeons & Dragons adventure set in the **Feywild, the Plane of Faerie**
* Two new races—play as a **fairy** or as a **harengon**, a race of humanoid rabbits
* New ways to face encounters, including non combat options to allow players to think and roleplay their way through the adventure
* The return of **Warduke**, **Strongheart**, **Kelek** and other classic Dungeons & Dragons characters
* Includes a map of the Witchlight Carnival and **Prismeer, the Feywild Domain of Delight**
