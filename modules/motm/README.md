# Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse

Buy Monsters of the Multiverse for a monstrous volume of options for D&D players and Dungeon Masters alike:

#### For Players

- Includes **over 30 playable races**. Monsters of the Multiverse brings all the game’s setting-agnostic races into one book and adds even more options for your next character created on D&D Beyond’s **Character Builder**.
- Updated format that makes playable races relevant for **any class**\--on any world--in the multiverse.

#### For Dungeon Masters

- Includes **over 250 monsters** to challenge your players and use in the D&D Beyond **Encounters tool**. Updates to the monsters include making spellcasters easier for Dungeon Masters to run; giving many monsters more damage and resilience; and improving the organization of monster stats.
- **A multiverse of lore**. Includes updates to monster lore that refocuses the stories on the D&D multiverse, rather than on any particular world.

#### **FACE THE DENIZENS OF THE COSMOS**

Sparkling with the musings of the wizard Mordenkainen, this tome features a host of creatures for use in the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. Hailing from every corner of the multiverse, these creatures represent some of the most benevolent and malevolent forces that D&D heroes might face.

The book also gathers together fantastical peoples from many different worlds. Each of these peoples represents a race option when you create your D&D character, expanding on the choices in the Player’s Handbook.

Compiling and updating monsters that originally appeared in *Volo’s Guide to Monsters* and *Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes*, this book presents friends and foes for any D&D campaign, many of them accompanied by the comments of Mordenkainen. The wizard has faced many of these monsters and peoples on numerous wondrous adventures. Now it’s time for you to venture forth and face these creatures yourself!
