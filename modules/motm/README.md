Buy Monsters of the Multiverse for a monstrous volume of options for D&D players and Dungeon Masters alike:

#### For Players

- Updated format that makes playable races relevant for **any class**\--on any world--in the multiverse.

#### For Dungeon Masters

- **A multiverse of lore**. Includes updates to monster lore that refocuses the stories on the D&D multiverse, rather than on any particular world.

> FACE THE DENIZENS OF THE COSMOS

Sparkling with the musings of the wizard Mordenkainen, this tome features a host of creatures for use in the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. Hailing from every corner of the multiverse, these creatures represent some of the most benevolent and malevolent forces that D&D heroes might face.

The book also gathers together fantastical peoples from many different worlds. Each of these peoples represents a race option when you create your D&D character, expanding on the choices in the Player’s Handbook.

Compiling and updating monsters that originally appeared in *Volo’s Guide to Monsters* and *Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes*, this book presents friends and foes for any D&D campaign, many of them accompanied by the comments of Mordenkainen. The wizard has faced many of these monsters and peoples on numerous wondrous adventures. Now it’s time for you to venture forth and face these creatures yourself!
