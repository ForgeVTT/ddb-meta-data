# Candlekeep Mysteries

> A collection of 17 Mysterious 5th edition Adventures for Players Level 1-16

Historians, sages, and others who crave knowledge flock to the library fortress of Candlekeep to peruse its vast collection of books, scribbled into which are the answers to the mysteries that bedevil them. Many of these books contain their own mysteries—each one a doorway to adventure. Will your players dare to cross that threshold?

_Candlekeep Mysteries_ is a collection of seventeen short, stand-alone adventures designed for characters of levels 1-16. These adventures can be run as one-shot games, plugged into an existing Forgotten Realms campaign, or easily adapted for other campaign settings.
