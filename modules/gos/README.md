# Ghosts of Saltmarsh

> A High Sea Adventure Collection for Levels 1-12

Nestled on the coast of the Azure Sea is Saltmarsh, a sleepy fishing village that sits on the precipice of destruction. Smugglers guide their ships to hidden coves, willing to slit the throat of anyone fool enough to cross their path. Cruel sahuagin gather beneath the waves, plotting to sweep away coastal cities. While Saltmarsh slumbers, the evils that seek to plunder it grow stronger.
