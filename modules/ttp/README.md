# The Tortle Package

This supplement also introduces a new playable character race, the tortle, and a new adventure location: Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace. All of this is permissible for play within the D&D Adventurers League.

The Snout of Omgar is a geographical region described briefly in *Tomb of Annihilation*.

Not much is revealed about the location or its inhabitants in that adventure, however. *The Tortle Package* is written for Dungeon Masters who want to know more about the Snout of Omgar.
