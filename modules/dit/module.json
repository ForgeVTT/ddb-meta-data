At that time, it also served as a playtest for the rules that eventually became the fifth edition of the game. This version of the adventure has been modified for home play.</p><p>Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon, the adventure is a tribute to <em>Tomb of Horrors</em>, <em>Ruins of Undermountain</em>, and other killer dungeons from the game's history.</p>",
