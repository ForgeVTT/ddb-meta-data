# Dead in Thay

> Adventure for Levels 9-11

### ABOUT THE ORIGINAL

_Dead in Thay_, by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was originally produced in 2014 as an adventure for the D&D Encounters organized play program. At that time, it also served as a playtest for the rules that eventually became the fifth edition of the game. This version of the adventure has been modified for home play.

Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon, the adventure is a tribute to _Tomb of Horrors_, _Ruins of Undermountain_, and other killer dungeons from the game's history.
