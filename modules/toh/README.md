# Tomb of Horrors

Tomb of Horrors was born in Gary Gygax's home campaign and introduced to the world at the first Origins game convention in 1975\. Since its original publication in 1978, Tomb of Horrors has risen to legendary status among D&D players and is generally regarded as one of the greatest adventures of all time. In the words of its creator, “This is a thinking person's adventure.” It was designed not for player characters of a certain level — though high-level adventurers are certainly necessary — but for players who enjoy a mental challenge and DMs who want to put their own spin on this truly unique dungeon.
